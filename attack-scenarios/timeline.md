# Attack Timeline – SSH Brute Force

This timeline outlines the sequence of actions performed by the attacker during the SSH brute force attack scenario.

| Time (Approx) | Phase           | Action Description |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| T0            | Reconnaissance  | SSH service identified using Nmap |
| T1            | Initial Access  | Repeated SSH authentication failures observed |
| T2            | Credential Access | Valid SSH credentials discovered |
| T3            | Access Achieved | Successful SSH login to target system |

This timeline reflects a common brute force attack pattern observed in real-world environments.
