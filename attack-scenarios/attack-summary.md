# Attack Scenario Summary

This attack scenario demonstrates how exposed SSH services can be abused through brute force techniques to gain unauthorized access.

The attacker identified an accessible SSH service, performed credential guessing, and successfully authenticated after multiple failed attempts.

All activity was logged, collected, and detected by the SOC monitoring stack, validating the effectiveness of centralized logging and security monitoring.
