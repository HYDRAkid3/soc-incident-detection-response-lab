# Investigation

This directory documents the **SOC investigation workflow** following detected attack activity in the Mini SOC Lab.

The focus is on:
- Alert triage
- Correlation analysis
- Analyst decision-making
- Incident response and mitigation
- Lessons learned and improvement opportunities

Each file represents a **real SOC artifact**, written from the perspective of a security analyst responding to an incident.

The investigation files build upon:
- Attack telemetry from `attack-scenarios/`
- Detection logic from `detections/`

Together, they represent the **full incident lifecycle**.
