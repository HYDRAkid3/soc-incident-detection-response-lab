# 🧪 Mini SOC Lab – Complete Build Guide

This guide is designed for anyone who wants to **build a realistic Security Operations Center (SOC) lab**, not just install tools.

If you are:
- A cybersecurity student
- An aspiring SOC analyst
- Someone preparing for SOC / Blue Team interviews
- Or simply curious how real SOC workflows work

This guide will help you **build the same Mini SOC Lab** used in this project.

## 🎯 What You Will Build

By following this guide, you will deploy:

- A **Kali Linux attacker** to simulate real adversary behavior
- An **Ubuntu Linux endpoint** acting as a monitored production system
- A **Wazuh-based SOC platform** for detection, investigation, and response

More importantly, you will understand:
- Why each component exists
- What telemetry matters in a SOC
- How attacks turn into alerts
- How analysts investigate incidents

This is **not a copy-paste tutorial**.
It is a **learning-focused, SOC-first lab design guide**.

## 📌 What This Guide Is — and Is Not

✅ This guide explains:
- Architecture decisions
- Tool selection rationale
- How components interact
- How to validate telemetry

❌ This guide does NOT:
- Replace official installation docs
- Provide exploit walkthroughs
- Mix lab setup with incident documentation

The goal is to help you **build confidently**, then **experiment freely**.

## 🧠 Recommended Mindset

Treat this lab like a **real SOC environment**, even though it’s small.

- Break things
- Observe logs
- Ask “why did this alert fire?”
- Document everything

That mindset matters more than the tools themselves.
